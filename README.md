# XYZ-Reader
This is the XYZ Reader(P5) project under Udacity Android Nanodegree Program

#User Feedback:

This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places.I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.

Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision.

The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.
